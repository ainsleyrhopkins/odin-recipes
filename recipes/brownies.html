    <h3>Brownies</h3>
    <p>I am fairly certain my husband married me so that I would keep making him these brownies. I regret ever making them, because now he simply won't accept a 
        boxed brownie mix. Make at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>250 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>80 g unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>65 g all purpose flour</li>
            <li>up to 75 g chocolate chips (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 F</li>
            <li>Line the bottom of an 8 in square pan with tin foil. Grease and flour the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Combine butter, salt, sugar, and cocoa in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Melt together until the mixture is slightly simmering. Do not let
                the mixture come to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>Let the mixture cool for 5 minutes, then mix in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, whisking on high after each one. Batter should be very thick and shiny after both eggs are added.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour with a spatula, and then beat the mixture for 3-5 minutes with the spatula. Batter should still be thick and shiny.</li>
            <li>Add in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out <em>almost</em> clean.</li>
        </ol>
